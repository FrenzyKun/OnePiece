                        <p> The Worst Generation is a term referring to twelve infamous pirates who emerged immediately before the beginning of the War at Marineford. They are one of the biggest powers on the sea, and have certainly lived up to their name. Currently, two of the Yonko come from the Worst Generation, which in itself shows that they are not to be taken lightly. </p>

                        <p> The Five Elders are a council of the five highest-ranking Celestial Dragons who act as the public heads of the World Government. They essentially hold the greatest authority over the world at large as far as public knowledge is concerned, although they secretly act as figureheads for the government's shadow leader Imu, who occupies the Empty Throne. </p>

                        <p> For the founder of the World Government from the Nerona Family, see Nerona Imu.
Imu is the real supreme leader of the World Government occupying the Empty Throne and whom even the Five Elders bow to and serve the every whim of. However, Imu's existence is kept an absolute secret within the government and the world at large, to maintain the lie that there is no singular ruler of the world. </p>
